# MUA-RAT-V2

MUA Remote Control Trojan HorseV2，MUA Remote Access Trojan V2

## Notice

[previous version](https://github.com/iyzyi/Mua-Remote-Control-Trojan)Due to the limited development cycle, the architecture is very chaotic, so I completely redeveloped the V2 version from 0。

However: there are still some false functions, bugs, and memory leaks, which are only semi-finished products at present, please do not download and use them for the time being. I will delete this section description when it is updated to a finished product。

Remind again, please do not download and use at present! Please do not download and use! Please do not download and use！

## Prepare

It is necessary to compile the three static libraries of Hp-Socket, Crypto++, and MsgPack, and you can download it from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zTvOdyzNayLAoXSSazcDBA?pwd=muma) 或 [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14ESrwA3k5k7WQ7BcW72zcMCJFRp9bbNd?usp=sharing) Download what I compiled in advance and put it into the corresponding folder.
